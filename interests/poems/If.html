	<h4>If</h4>
	<p align = "justify">
		<strong>Rudyard Kipling</strong>
	</p><br>

	<p align = "justify">
			If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
			Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
			If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
			But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
			If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
			Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
			Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
			And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
	</p>

	<p align = "justify">
			If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
			If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
			If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
			And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
			If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
			Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
			Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
			And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
	</p>

	<p align = "justify">
			If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
			And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
			And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
			And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
			If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
			To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
			And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
			Except the Will which says to them: &#39;Hold on!&#39;
	</p>

	<p align = "justify">
			If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
			Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
			If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
			If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
			If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
			With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br>
			Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
			And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
