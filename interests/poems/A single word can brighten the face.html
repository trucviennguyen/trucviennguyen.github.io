	<h4>A single word can brighten the face</h4>
	<p align = "justify">
		<strong>Yunus Emre</strong><br>
		<strong>English version by Kabir Helminski &amp; Refik Algan</strong>
	</p><br>

	<p align = "justify">
			A single word can brighten the face<br>
			of one who knows the value of words.<br>
			Ripened in silence, a single word<br>
			acquires a great energy for work.
	</p>

	<p align = "justify">
			War is cut short by a word,<br>
			and a word heals the wounds,<br>
			and there’s a word that changes<br>
			poison into butter and honey.
	</p>

	<p align = "justify">
			Let a word mature inside yourself.<br>
			Withhold the unripened thought.<br>
			Come and understand the kind of word<br>
			that reduces money and riches to dust.
	</p>

	<p align = "justify">
			Know when to speak a word<br>
			and when not to speak at all.<br>
			A single word turns the universe of hell<br>
			into eight paradises.
	</p>

	<p align = "justify">
			Follow the Way. Don’t be fooled<br>
			by what you already know. Be watchful.<br>
			Reflect before you speak.<br>
			A foolish mouth can brand your soul.
	</p>

	<p align = "justify">
			Yunus, say one last thing<br>
			about the power of words &#45;<br>
			Only the word &quot;I&quot;<br>
			divides me from God.
