			<strong>Stories about coffee and life</strong><br>
				A group of highly educated students visited their old university professor. Conversation soon turned into complaints about stress in work and life.<br>
				Offering them coffee, professor returned from kitchen with a pot of coffee and an assortment of cups- porcelain, glass, crystal, some plain looking, some expensive, some exquisite - telling them to help themselves to hot coffee.<br>
				When all had a cup of coffee in hand, The professor said:<br>
				&quot;If you noticed, all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up, leaving behind the plain ones. While it’s but normal for you to want only the best, that’s also the source of your stress. What you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, But you still went for the best cups and were eyeing each other’s cups!&quot;.<br>
				If life is coffee, then jobs, money and status in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain Life.<br>
				Don’t let the cups drive you. Enjoy your coffee more than the cup that holds it.<br>
