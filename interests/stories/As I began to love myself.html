				As I began to love myself I found that anguish and emotional suffering are only warning signs that I was living against my own truth. Today, I know, this is &quot;AUTHENTICITY&quot;.
			</p>
			<p align = "justify">
				As I began to love myself I understood how much it can offend somebody if I try to force my desires on this person, even though I knew the time was not right and the person was not ready for it, and even though this person was me. Today I call it &quot;RESPECT&quot;.
			</p>
			<p align = "justify">
				As I began to love myself I stopped craving for a different life, and I could see that everything that surrounded me was inviting me to grow. Today I call it &quot;MATURITY&quot;.<br>
				As I began to love myself I understood that at any circumstance, I am in the right place at the right time, and everything happens at the exactly right moment. So I could be calm. Today I call it &quot;SELF-CONFIDENCE&quot;.
			</p>
			<p align = "justify">
				As I began to love myself I quit stealing my own time, and I stopped designing huge projects for the future. Today, I only do what brings me joy and happiness, things I love to do and that make my heart cheer, and I do them in my own way and in my own rhythm. Today I call it &quot;SIMPLICITY&quot;.
			</p>
			<p align = "justify">
				As I began to love myself I freed myself of anything that is no good for my health â€“ food, people, things, situations, and everything that drew me down and away from myself. At first I called this attitude a healthy egoism. Today I know it is &quot;LOVE OF ONESELF&quot;.
			</p>
			<p align = "justify">
				As I began to love myself I quit trying to always be right, and ever since I was wrong less of the time. Today I discovered that is &quot;MODESTY&quot;.
			</p>
			<p align = "justify">
				As I began to love myself I refused to go on living in the past and worrying about the future. Now, I only live for the moment, where everything is happening. Today I live each day, day by day, and I call it &quot;FULFILLMENT&quot;.
			</p>
			<p align = "justify">
				As I began to love myself I recognized that my mind can disturb me and it can make me sick. But as I connected it to my heart, my mind became a valuable ally. Today I call this connection &quot;WISDOM OF THE HEART&quot;.
			</p>
			<p align = "justify">
				We no longer need to fear arguments, confrontations or any kind of problems with ourselves or others. Even stars collide, and out of their crashing new worlds are born. Today I know &quot;THAT IS LIFE&quot;!
