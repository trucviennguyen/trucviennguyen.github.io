	<p align = "justify">
			One day you finally knew<br>
			what you had to do, and began,<br>
			though the voices around you<br>
			kept shouting<br>
			their bad advice&#45;&#45;<br>
			though the whole house<br>
			began to tremble<br>
			and you felt the old tug<br>
			at your ankles.<br>
			"Mend my life!"<br>
			each voice cried.<br>
			But you didn't stop.<br>
			You knew what you had to do,<br>
			though the wind pried<br>
			with its stiff fingers<br>
			at the very foundations,<br>
			though their melancholy<br>
			was terrible.<br>
			It was already late<br>
			enough, and a wild night,<br>
			and the road full of fallen<br>
			branches and stones.<br>
			But little by little,<br>
			as you left their voices behind,<br>
			the stars began to burn<br>
			through the sheets of clouds,<br>
			and there was a new voice<br>
			which you slowly<br>
			recognized as your own,<br>
			that kept you company<br>
			as you strode deeper and deeper<br>
			into the world,<br>
			determined to do<br>
			the only thing you could do&#45;&#45;<br>
			determined to save<br>
			the only life you could save.
