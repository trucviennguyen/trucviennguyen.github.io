In the last some weeks, I've decided to work more with <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>. The purpose is to advance my skills in Machine Learning in general and to see my results compared to others. With the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">Titanic</a> dataset, my very first submission to Kaggle was ranked about &lt; 500 &#128528;. More to improve &#128523; and more to come &#128522;.

Today, I started to work with <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/grupo-bimbo-inventory-demand">Grupo Bimbo</a>, another Kaggle competition with different kind of data and different machine learning tasks: Time Series Analysis with Regression. My first results were somewhere  &lt; 600 &#128523;.
