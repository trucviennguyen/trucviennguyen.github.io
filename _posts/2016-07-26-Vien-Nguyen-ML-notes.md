In 2004, I started to work in a research project funded by Vietnamese government. It was about to build a Semantic Web infrastructure for Vietnamese online news articles. I was so passionate about the work and the results achieved. Later on, when I started the Ph.D. in 2007, I realized that most of my previous work was just on the engineering part, that what I did was based on rule-based and there was no intelligent part. With the help of my advisor, I began to explore the beauty of Machine Learning. Since my advisor is an expert of Kernel Methods, we invented novel kernels, mainly for Knowledge Extraction from text. I was so passionate and confident about the future of the methodology.

Short time after starting my first post-doc, I realized, again, that the engineering and programming play a very significant role in research. Idea comes first, but without good programming, it will achieve nothing. At the moment, I perceive the importance of programming, of technologies part in shaping the role of a scientist, that I somehow missed.

I've tried to fill the technology gaps that I missed in the years of diving into theoretical research. Within a short time, I became an expert of different programming languages: R, Python, big data technologies: Hadoop, Spark. I believe in the potential of Data Science. In a near future, it can improve financial, e-commerce, retail companies, and more than that, especially with the support from Machine Learning. That doesn't mean everything is towards the positive. That also means, many jobs will become useless, with softwares which do automatized work. However, if that time comes, people will become more capable, more intelligent to handle such softwares and manage more important tasks.
