In the last some weeks, I've decided to work more with Kaggle. The purpose is to advance my skills in Machine Learning in general and to see my results compared to others. It wasn't easy at first. With the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">Titanic</a> dataset, my very first submission to Kaggle was ranked about &gt; 2000 &#128530;. The first code was written in Python. Thanks to some nice online tutorials, I've added some feature engineering. My best results so far was somewhere &gt; 1200 &#128528;. I am not trying to be the first, which I'm afraid I won't be able to reach &#128523;, but I target myself to be ranked somewhere &lt; 100, then &lt; 20.
