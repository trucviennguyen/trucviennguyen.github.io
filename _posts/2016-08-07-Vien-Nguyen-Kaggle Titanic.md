In the last some weeks, I've decided to work more with Kaggle. The purpose is to advance my skills in Machine Learning in general and to see my results compared to others. It wasn't easy at first. With the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">Titanic</a> dataset, my very first submission to Kaggle was ranked about &gt; 2000 &#128530;. The first code was written in Python. Thanks to some nice online tutorials, I've added some feature engineering. I then moved to R, which allows with some more robust functions with less (lines of code). My best results so far was somewhere &gt; 1200 &#128528;. More to improve &#128523; and more to come &#128522;.

Today, I started to work with <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/grupo-bimbo-inventory-demand">Grupo Bimbo</a>, another Kaggle competition with different kind of data and different machine learning task: Time Series Analysis with Regression.
