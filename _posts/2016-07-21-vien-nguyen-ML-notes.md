Recently I started to explore the great potential of Deep Learning. Thanks to the excellent [tutorial] (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) and I can use deep features to classify images in [Caltech101] (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/). It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. Finally I could train deep convolutional network to answer questions related to images in the [VQA] (https://github.com/trucviennguyen/VQA) problem.
