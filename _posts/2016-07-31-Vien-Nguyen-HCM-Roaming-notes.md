My friends and I went to a shopping mall Aeon in Bình Tân district, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. It was a newly inaugurated mall in Ho Chi Minh City, where there was full of people and much less air to breath. After roaming around for two hours or so, we selected a couple of T-shirts, some underwares, some swimming-costume for the next trip. We came to the next floor and enjoyed drinks. After shopping, tt was fantastic to enjoy iced coffee and iced matcha in a super hot afternoon in a tropical climate city.

However, as we got out of the mall, following our memory and the way we got there, we still could not manage to get out of Bình Tân district. During one hour or so, we were stuck riding on our motocycles, going around the streets Tên Lửa, Kinh Dương Vương, Bà Hom, Tỉnh Lộ 10, Mã Lò, Hương Lộ 2, Thoại Ngọc Hầu. Finally, after asking some good Saigon people, we managed to come to Luỹ Bán Bích street and got home safely. Wow!!!

After all, it was a nice afternoon to know more about the busy city, still in developing :-).
